Serialization Program

This program serializes an object to a file and then deserializes (reassembles it).

Before accessing the example, some vital things should be understood first:

====(1) WHAT IS SERIALIZATION?====
	- An object can be represented as a a sequence of bytes. These bytes can include the object's data, such as its type, and types of data stored in that object.
	- This in turn allows the object to be easily saved to storage or streamed across a communication link.
	
====(2) WHAT IS DESERIALIZATION?====
	- As the name suggests, deserialization rebuilds the object after reading the stream of bytes from the file.

====(3) WHY IS SERIALIZATION AWESOME/USEFUL?====
	- Serialization is JVM independent. That means an object can be serialized on one platform and deserialized on a completely different one.

====(4) TERMINOLOGY FROM PROGRAM====
	-Transient: Fields that are preceded by "transient" will not be considered during serialization (Notice the SSN after deserializing -- it's 0).
	-.Ser extension: The standard convention in Java is to give the file a�".ser"�extension when serializing.
	- java.io.Serializable interface: Must be implement in order to serialize an object.
